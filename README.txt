This p5.js app takes data from the New Zealand GeoNet website https://api.geonet.org.nz/.
It takes information about the last 100 earthquakes to happen in New Zealand. 
The program moves through each earthquake chronologically and displays them as a black dot and an earthquake sound. 
The date of each earthquake is also displayed on the screen.
